# 📘 ISLP: Labs and Concepts  
### *An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python*

Welcome! This repository is a personal project where I explore, implement, and document the **labs**, **concepts**, and **techniques** presented in the book *An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python (ISLP)* by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani.

## 🎯 Objective

This project is focused on:

- Working through all **lab exercises** chapter by chapter
- Reinforcing understanding of **statistical learning concepts**
- Applying these methods to real datasets using **Python**
- Creating a clean, modular, and reproducible codebase
- Building a strong foundation in **machine learning** and **data analysis**

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each chapter is organized into its own folder. Here's how the structure looks:

```
ISLP/
├── Chapter01-Introduction/
│   └── notes.md
├── Chapter02-Statistical-Learning/
│   ├── lab.ipynb
│   └── notes.md
├── Chapter03-Linear-Regression/
│   ├── lab.ipynb
│   └── concepts.md
...
├── Chapter12-Deep-Learning/
│   ├── lab.ipynb
│   └── summary.md
├── datasets/
└── README.md
```

Each chapter may contain:
- `lab.ipynb` or `lab.py`: Code implementations of lab exercises
- `notes.md` or `concepts.md`: My personal explanations and breakdown of key ideas
- Additional files for visualizations, helper functions, or project-specific data
